Unicode Representations of Strings

When a Unicode string is written to a text file or some other storage, the Unicode scalars in that string are encoded in one of several Unicode-defined encoding forms. Each form encodes the string in small chunks known as code units. These include the UTF-8 encoding form (which encodes a string as 8-bit code units), the UTF-16 encoding form (which encodes a string as 16-bit code units), and the UTF-32 encoding form (which encodes a string as 32-bit code units).

Swift provides several different ways to access Unicode representations of strings. You can iterate over the string with a for-in statement, to access its individual Character values as Unicode extended grapheme clusters. This process is described in Working with Characters.
    
    Alternatively, access a String value in one of three other Unicode-compliant representations:
    
    A collection of UTF-8 code units (accessed with the string‚Äôs utf8 property)
    A collection of UTF-16 code units (accessed with the string‚Äôs utf16 property)
    A collection of 21-bit Unicode scalar values, equivalent to the string‚Äôs UTF-32 encoding form (accessed with the string‚Äôs unicodeScalars property)
    Each example below shows a different representation of the following string, which is made up of the characters D, o, g, ‚Äº (DOUBLE EXCLAMATION MARK, or Unicode scalar U+203C), and the üê∂ character (DOG FACE, or Unicode scalar U+1F436):

let dogString = "Dog‚Äºüê∂"
UTF-8 Representation
You can access a UTF-8 representation of a String by iterating over its utf8 property. This property is of type String.UTF8View, which is a collection of unsigned 8-bit (UInt8) values, one for each byte in the string‚Äôs UTF-8 representation:
