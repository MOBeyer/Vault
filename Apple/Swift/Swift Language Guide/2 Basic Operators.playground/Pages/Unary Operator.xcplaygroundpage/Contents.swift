Unary Minus Operator
The sign of a numeric value can be toggled using a prefixed -, known as the unary minus operator:

let three = 3
let minusThree = -three       // minusThree equals -3
let plusThree = -minusThree   // plusThree equals 3, or "minus minus three"
The unary minus operator (-) is prepended directly before the value it operates on, without any white space.

Unary Plus Operator
The unary plus operator (+) simply returns the value it operates on, without any change:

let minusSix = -6
let alsoMinusSix = +minusSix  // alsoMinusSix equals -6
Although the unary plus operator doesnâ€™t actually do anything, you can use it to provide symmetry in your code for positive numbers when also using the unary minus operator for negative numbers.
