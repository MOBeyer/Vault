Control Transfer Statements

Control transfer statements change the order in which your code is executed, by transferring control from one piece of code to another. Swift has five control transfer statements:

continue
break
fallthrough
return
throw
The continue, break, and fallthrough statements are described below. The return statement is described in Functions, and the throw statement is described in Propagating Errors Using Throwing Functions.
