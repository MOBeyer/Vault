# Enum raw values
Sometimes you need to be able to assign values to enums so they have meaning. This lets you create them dynamically, and also use them in different ways.

For example, you might create a `Planet` enum that stores integer values for each of its cases:
*/
//#-editable-code Enter your code here
enum Planet: Int {
    case mercury
    case venus
    case earth
    case mars
}
//#-end-editable-code
/*:
Swift will automatically assign each of those a number starting from 0, and you can use that number to create an instance of the appropriate enum case. For example, `earth` will be given the number 2, so you can write this:
*/
//#-editable-code Enter your code here
let earth = Planet(rawValue: 2)
//#-end-editable-code
/*:
If you want, you can assign one or more cases a specific value, and Swift will generate the rest. Itâ€™s not very natural for us to think of Earth as the second planet, so you could write this:
*/
//#-editable-code Enter your code here
enum Planet: Int {
    case mercury = 1
    case venus
    case earth
    case mars
}
//#-end-editable-code
/*:
Now Swift will assign 1 to `mercury` and count upwards from there, meaning that `earth` is now the third planet.*/
