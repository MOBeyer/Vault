# Introduction
Hello, my name is Paul Hudson, and I run a website called hackingwithswift.com. I’ve written more books about Swift than anyone else in the world, so if you want to learn Swift in a fast and easy way you’ve come to the right person.

This series is called Swift in Sixty Seconds, because each part teaches you one distinct Swift concept in just one minute or less. So, there’s no time for me to go off on tangents, and there’s no time for those annoying “hey what’s up you guys it’s me again” intros that are so common on YouTube.

Instead, you should sit back and prepare to learn Swift in bite-size chunks. 

Most Swift code is written using Apple’s development environment, Xcode. You should install Xcode from the Mac App Store, then go ahead and run it before continuing.
  
Are you all set? Let’s go!

- Important: Although I’m using Xcode on a Mac in this book, you can use Swift Playgrounds on your iPad if you prefer. Use whichever one is easiest for you – they are both great places to learn Swift.

In this playground book you’ll find the text for each chapter alongside the video. Both contain the same content, so again just use whichever one is easiest for you.

As you’ll see, sometimes the videos make an adjustment to earlier code in order to demonstrate a technique. **This isn’t possible in the text version, so occasionally Swift Playgrounds will show a red dot to signal an issue.** If you’re not sure, watching the video should help clarify things.*/
