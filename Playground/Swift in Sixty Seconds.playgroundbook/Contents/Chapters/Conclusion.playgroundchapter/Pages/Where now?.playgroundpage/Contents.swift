# Where now?

You’ve made it to the end of Swift in Sixty Seconds – I hope you’re proud of all the work you’ve put in! Don’t worry if you found some things hard: topics such as closures and optionals *are* hard, so if they took some time to learn that’s just a sign your brain is working properly.

Now, the question is: where can you go next? Well, I publish a range of books that I hope will help you answer that question:

- If you’d like to start using Swift to make iOS apps, you should read Hacking with Swift. It’s available free online [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) but you can buy the premium edition with bonus content [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/hacking-with-swift).
- If you’d like to improve your knowledge of the Swift language, tackling more advanced features such as generics, custom operators, and functional programming, you should read Pro Swift. It’s available to buy [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/pro-swift).
- If you’d like to learn to make games using Swift, you’re ready for my book Dive Into SpriteKit – you get to choose how each game project should develop. It’s available to buy [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/dive-into-spritekit).
- If you’d like to try other Apple platforms, I have books teaching [macOS](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/hacking-with-macos), [watchOS](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/hacking-with-watchos), and [tvOS](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/hacking-with-tvos).

Congratulations on finishing Swift in Sixty Seconds – I hope you learned a lot, and that you’re able to have a lot of fun with your new coding skills!*/
