/*:
# Creating your own classes
Classes are similar to structs in that they allow you to create new types with properties and methods, but they have five important differences and Iâ€™m going to walk you through each of those differences one at a time.

The first difference between classes and structs is that classes never come with a memberwise initializer. This means if you have properties in your class, you must always create your own initializer.

For example:
*/
//#-editable-code Enter your code here
class Dog {
    var name: String
    var breed: String
    
    init(name: String, breed: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
    }
}
//#-end-editable-code
/*:
Creating instances of that class looks just the same as if it were a struct:
*/
//#-editable-code Enter your code here
let poppy = Dog(name: "Poppy", breed: "Poodle")
//#-end-editable-code
